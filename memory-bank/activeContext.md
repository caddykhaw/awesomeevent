# Active Context

## Current Focus
- UI Implementation Planning Phase with Vue.js and DaisyUI

## Recent Decisions
1. Technology Stack Selection
   - Vue.js + Vite for frontend framework
   - Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI for styling
   - Pinia for state management

   - Hono for backend API
   - SQLite/Turso for database
   - Clerk for authentication
   - Cloudflare for deployment

2. Architecture Decisions
   - Component-based architecture with Vue.js
   - Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
   - PWA implementation
   - Edge-ready with Hono and Cloudflare Workers

## Implementation Plan
1. Core Infrastructure
   - Project scaffolding with Vite
   - Monorepo setup for frontend and backend
   - Basic routing with vue-router
   - State management with Pinia
   - API client setup with vue-query

2. UI Components (Inspired by Howei.com and Eventbrite)
   - Shared Components
     - Navigation bar with authentication
     - Footer with site sections
     - Loading states and skeletons
     - Error boundaries
   
   - Event Discovery
     - Event cards with dynamic layouts
     - Advanced search filters
     - Category navigation
     - Featured events carousel
